### Personal Motto

July is my birth month. It is also the mid-point of the year. So every year, I pick a phrase or keyword to serve as a guiding rule for a new habit or behavior I want to instill.
 * July 2020: `Visualize IT!` - sketch the docs | improve understanding & recall.
 * July 2021: `Cultivate Irreverence` - find the humor | build self-care & resilience.
