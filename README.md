### Vanakkam! 👋🏽👩🏽‍💻🔥♥️

Hello! I'm Nitya. 
"Vanakkam" is how you say Hello in Tamil, my mother tongue, and one of the ancient languages of India.

It's hard to distill decades in tech into a few bullet points, but here goes.
 * **I'm a PhD in Computer Engineering.** My thesis focused on middleware for survivable distributed Java systems.
 * **I'm a Parent.** I believe in lifelong learning and instilling a sense of curiosity and creativity in kids.
 * **I'm a Polyglot.** At various times I have worked in: C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Dart, Python, and even Pascal.
 * **I'm a Public Speaker, an Innovator, and Educator.** I believe in paying it forward, and making connections that matter.

I've worked on software and systems, in research & development roles, across industry, academia and startups.
My technology interests span mobile & web development, distributed systems, ubiquitous computing, cloud & AI.

I'm currently focused on technology and community advocacy, on the Developer Relations team at Microsoft.
In my spare time, I am passionate about visual storytelling, community building, and exploring my culture.

**My mission statement:** 
> I want to make _complex_ concepts understandable to _diverse_ audiences in ways that drive _actionable_ impact.
