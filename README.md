### Vanakkam! 👋🏽👩🏽‍💻🔥♥️

Hello! I'm Nitya. And "Vanakkam" is how you say Hello in Tamil, my mother tongue and one of the ancient languages of India.

Five things to know about me:
- 👩🏽‍🎓 I earned a PhD in Computer Engineering (distributed systems, survivability)
- 👩🏽‍💻 I've spent 20+ years in tech building systems, software and communities! (mobile & web, cloud & AI)
- 🙇🏽‍♂️ I'm the proud and invested parent of [a curious 11yo](https://twitter.com/nitya/status/1284845105074102272)
- 👩🏽‍🎨 I am a sketchnoter and aspiring creative technologist: [See: SketchTheDocs](https://sketchthedocs.dev)
- 🤗 I believe in [continuous learning](https://dev.to/nitya/i-m-a-lifelong-beginner-are-you-2ac6) and [standing up for the right thing](https://twitter.com/nitya/status/1283389744014073856)

In 2010 I [spoke at my first Meetup](https://www.slideshare.net/nitya/the-evolution-of-social-search). <br/>
Since then I've built physical communities ([GDG NYC](meetup.com/gdgnyc), [GDG Hudson Valley](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-hudson-valley/)) and virtual ones ([Flutter FYI](https://twitter.com/flutterfyi), [MakeTheTalkHappen](https://twitter.com/MakeTalkHappen)), organized conferences ([DevFest NYC](https://devfestnyc.com/), [IWD NYC](https://iwd2018.splashthat.com/)) and workshops ([Android Camp](https://androidcamp.splashthat.com/), [FlutterCamp](https://fluttercamp2018.splashthat.com/), [PWACamp](https://pwacamp2017.splashthat.com/), [HourOfCode](https://hourofcode2016.splashthat.com/), [GlobalDiversityCFPDay](https://gdcfpday-2018-nyc.splashthat.com/)). It began what is now a lifelong journey into community and technology advocacy.

In 2018 I was recognized as a _[Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-nitya_narasimhan)_ in Flutter, Dart and Web Technologies.

In 2019, I joined the _[Microsoft Developer Relations Team](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/)_, managing Regional Programs for North America. <br/>
Focus: Build & empower students, startups, and professional developer ecosystems across US and Canada.

Prior to joining Microsoft, I held other roles. I continue to be heavily invested in communities.
 - a VP Of Engineering (startup)
 - an Adjunct Faculty member (academia)
 - an Indepedent Developer (mobile, web, machine learning)
 - a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff (industry)
 - a Graduate Student Research/Teaching Assistant

I am a tech speaker and practioner with an interest in: <br/>
mobile & web development, ubiquitous computing, distributed systems, data analysis, visual storytelling, cloud & AI, public speaking, community building.
