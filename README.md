### Vanakkam! 👋🏽👩🏽‍💻🔥♥️

Hello! I'm Nitya. 
"Vanakkam" is how you say Hello in Tamil, my mother tongue, and one of the ancient languages of India.

I've been in tech for 20+ years focused on systems & software research, development and education.

 * **I'm a PhD in Computer Engineering.** My thesis focused on middleware for survivable distributed Java systems.
 * **I'm a Parent.** I believe in lifelong learning and instilling a sense of curiosity and creativity in kids.
 * **I'm a Polyglot.** At various times I have worked in: C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Dart, Python, and even Pascal.
 * **I'm a Community Builder.** I've founded tech meetups (NYC, Hudson Valley) & organized dev conferences (DevFestNYC, IWD NYC)
 * **I'm a Cloud Advocate.** On the Fusion Devs team in Microsoft Developer Relations. I want to empower mobile, web and citizen developers.
 * **I'm a Visual Storyteller.** It started as a self-care strategy and is now about creative communications. Let's #SketchTheDocs 

**My mission statement:** 
> I want to make _complex_ concepts understandable to _diverse_ audiences in ways that drive _actionable_ impact.
